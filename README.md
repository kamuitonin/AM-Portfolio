# "Who am I?" (Spider-Man - 2002)

I am a physicist, borned in a small city in Brazil named Eloi Mendes in the state of Minas Gerais (land of the best food - the "pao de queijo"). Enthusiastic for analytics and data science as powerful tools for companies to develop or improve their data-driven culture, I believe that digital transformation is necessary for companies to achieve the best results and offering the best service for their customers.
