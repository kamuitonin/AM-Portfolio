[Detailed Resume](https://github.com/kamuitonin/Portfolio/blob/master/202005_Resume-AM.pdf) 
I am a physicist, born in a small city in Brazil named Eloi Mendes in the state of Minas Gerais (land of the best food - the "pao de queijo"). Enthusiastic for analytics and data science as powerful tools for companies to develop or improve their data-driven culture, I believe that digital transformation will help companies achieving the best results and offering the best service for their customers.
